# Introduction

The set of files in this repository are made to act as a guide and to supplement the in-club tutorials, not provide complete detailed instructions on how to create Android apps. More detail will be provided in-club.
Each file highlights a basic fundamental concept in mobile app development.
Each new concept will add on to the same project as the previous, allowing viewers to follow the literal process of building an app step-by-step.

## Prerequisites

This series of tutorials requires some prior knowledge of Java syntax and concepts. Installation of the Android Studio IDE is also not included in the tutorials.

## ScribbleNotes

The ScribbleNotes example app (found [here](https://github.com/BA-Computer-Science-Club-2023-2024/ScribbleNotes)) plays a large role in the example code throughout the tutorials, as it is the app built in-class to act as a guide. For information about the app versions, for debugging purposes, go [here](../main/Scribble%20Notes%20Info.md).
